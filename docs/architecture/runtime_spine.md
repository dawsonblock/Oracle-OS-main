# Oracle-OS Runtime Spine

## Enforced execution path

All side effects are expected to flow through this spine:

```text
Intent
  → RuntimeOrchestrator.submitIntent(_:)
  → Planner.plan(...) -> Command
  → VerifiedExecutor.execute(_:)
  → CommandRouter
  → DomainRouter (SystemRouter / UIRouter / CodeRouter)
  → Execution
  → ExecutionOutcome(events)
  → CommitCoordinator.commit(_:) -> CommitReceipt
  → DomainEventCodec decodes typed events
  → Reducers apply events to WorldStateModel
  → StateSnapshot (immutable WorldModelSnapshot)
  → evaluation
```

`RuntimeExecutionDriver` is an adapter that translates `ActionIntent` inputs into
typed `Intent` values and forwards them to `IntentAPI.submitIntent(_:)`.

## Runtime invariants

1. `VerifiedExecutor.execute(_:)` is the only execution boundary for side effects.
2. `CommitCoordinator.commit(_:)` returns `CommitReceipt` with `snapshotID`.
3. Empty commits throw `CommitError.emptyCommit`.
4. Reducers are pure, idempotent event-to-state derivation functions.
5. `ExecutionOutcome` must include events on success and failure paths.
6. `RuntimeOrchestrator` coordinates planning, execution, commit, and evaluation.
7. `RuntimeBootstrap.makeDefault()` is the canonical kernel factory.

## Event typing

`DomainEvent` defines the typed event contract:

| Event | Payload | Reducer |
|-------|---------|--------|
| `intentReceived` | intentID | RuntimeStateReducer |
| `planGenerated` | commandKind | RuntimeStateReducer |
| `commandExecuted` | status, notes | RuntimeStateReducer |
| `commandFailed` | error, commandKind | RuntimeStateReducer |
| `evaluationCompleted` | criticOutcome | RuntimeStateReducer |
| `uiObserved` | app, window, url, elementCount | UIStateReducer |
| `memoryRecorded` | category, key | MemoryStateReducer |

`DomainEventCodec.decode(from:)` maps raw `EventEnvelope` to typed events.
Legacy event types (`CommandSucceeded`, `CommandFailed`) are mapped automatically.

## Key modules

| Module | File | Responsibility |
|--------|------|---------------|
| API | `Sources/OracleOS/API/IntentAPI.swift` | Runtime intake boundary |
| Bootstrap | `Sources/OracleOS/Runtime/RuntimeBootstrap.swift` | Canonical kernel factory |
| Orchestration | `Sources/OracleOS/Runtime/RuntimeOrchestrator.swift` | Linear runtime coordination |
| Planning | `Sources/OracleOS/Planning/MainPlanner+Planner.swift` | Intent -> Command planning |
| Execution | `Sources/OracleOS/Execution/VerifiedExecutor.swift` | Policy + routed command execution |
| Routing | `Sources/OracleOS/Execution/Routing/*.swift` | CommandRouter + domain router boundaries |
| Events | `Sources/OracleOS/Events/EventStore.swift` | Append-only event history |
| DomainEvent | `Sources/OracleOS/Events/DomainEvent.swift` | Typed event contract + codec |
| CommitReceipt | `Sources/OracleOS/Events/CommitReceipt.swift` | Immutable commit proof |
| Commit | `Sources/OracleOS/Events/CommitCoordinator.swift` | Number/append/reduce commit flow |
| Reducers | `Sources/OracleOS/State/Reducers/*.swift` | Pure, idempotent state derivation |
| Snapshot | `Sources/OracleOS/State/StateSnapshot.swift` | Immutable state capture |
| SnapshotStore | `Sources/OracleOS/State/Stores/SnapshotStore.swift` | Append-only snapshot history |

## Remaining hardening focus

- Keep `AgentLoop` intake-only and free of planning/execution logic.
- Keep all user-facing entrypoints (controller/CLI/MCP/recipes) on the same
  `IntentAPI -> RuntimeOrchestrator` path via `RuntimeBootstrap.makeDefault()`.
- Continue expanding architecture integrity tests that guard bypass regressions.
